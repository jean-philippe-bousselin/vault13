# meteor-boilerplate

This boilerplate is here to give you a starting point for your meteor projects, with a console tool to ease up some tasks. Essential atmosphere packages are included to give you features like routing and collection schemas out-of-the-box.

The boilerplate looks like following: [boilerplate.meteor.com](http://boilerplate.meteor.com). Have a look at [starthacking](http://starthacking.meteor.com/) for a project created with this boilerplate.

## Installing with orion-cli

```bash
npm install -g orion-cli
```

This will install the [orion-cli](https://github.com/matteodem/orion-cli) tool, which can be used for scaffolding files with different profiles.
You can still clone the repository, which doesn't give you the profile and scaffolding support.

## How to use

```sh
# Assuming meteor is already installed
orion create appName
cd appName && meteor
```

### Generating files

With orion-cli you can scaffold files based on your configuration that you've got.

```sh
orion generate routes
```

You can create models, views, change profiles and reset the project with the console tool (see below).


### Removing default code

There's already a lot of predefined code in this boilerplate, to show you the possible functionality. However, if you want to start off with an
empty project use the provided command to get rid off all the code you don't need.

```sh
orion reset
```

### Available profiles (cofeescript and es6)

* default (Plain Vanilla Javascript)
* coffee (coffeescript, Unfancy JavaScript)
* es6 (traceur, Traceur is a JavaScript.next-to-JavaScript-of-today compiler)

You can change your profile like that
```sh
orion set-profile
```

There will be a prompt, where you can enter __coffee__ or any other profile that you have specified. Also use the ```reset``` command to start off with blank files according to your profile.

### Deployments

It is highly recommended to use [Meteor Up](https://github.com/arunoda/meteor-up) for easy deployments. 
Have a look at the repository for more information.

### SEO and other concerns

> Meteor cannot do SEO 

This statement is only partially true, since there is a package called [ms-seo](https://github.com/DerMambo/ms-seo), which
has a lot of neat little tricks to help web crawlers notice your app the way you want them to. This boilerplate also adds constants under
__client/lib/constants.js__ for the app. Change SEO settings inside the routes like that.

```javascript
Router.route('/about', function () {
  this.render('about');
  // Using the app constants
  SEO.set({ title: 'About -' + Meteor.App.NAME, og: {...} });
});
```

### Adding allow rules for external URLs

The [browser-policy](https://atmospherejs.com/meteor/browser-policy) adds rules to deny all operations from external URLs.
This helps dealing with clickjacking and other XSS methods used to attack the client. To whitelist a url, add following to 
__server/config/security.js__

```javascript
BrowserPolicy.content.allowOriginForAll(YOUR_URL);
```

Other security enforcing packages like [audit-argument-checks](https://docs.meteor.com/#/full/auditargumentchecks) and 
[matteodem:easy-security](https://github.com/matteodem/meteor-easy-security) have also been added.
