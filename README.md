# Vault13
Web platform for social media sharing using [KOAN boilerplate](https://github.com/soygul/koan).

## Requirements
* Nodejs v0.11.x (I recommend > 0.11.13 to directly have Promises included into nodejs core)
* npm and bower to state the obvious
* Mongodb, any recent version

## Installation 
Just run setup.sh in the script folder
Sometimes npm has a hard time resolving dependencies, so you might want to install again or update.
